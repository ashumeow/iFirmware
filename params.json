Supports many Apple devices.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\n\r\nWell after seeing [iH8sn0w](http://ih8sn0w.com/)'s [https://github.com/iH8sn0w/sn0wbreeze](sn0wbreeze) in action, I had seen that it had a built in downloader for iOS firmwares, so I decided to make one of my own, a standalone iOS firmware downloader called iFirmware.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why Use iFirmware and How To Use It?\r\n\r\niTunes never keeps these iOS firmware files (.ipsw), and when restoring you have to re-download them. But with iFirmware that is all gone you can now download your iOS version for sepcific device of your choice and KEEP THE .ipsw FILE... forever. Then just hold shift when on Apple device dashboard on iTunes and click 'Restore', a dialog will appear, browse for the .ipsw file located in C:\\iFirmware\\'firmwarename' and then double click on it and let iTunes do the rest and restore you device.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\niFirmware is currently only compatible for 32-Bit arch machines but you could help out with a 64-Bit arch version of iFirmware by re-compiling the source code on your 64-Bit machine and pushing it to the _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master64)_ branch.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Not released yet.\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\n\r\nPlease note that when downloading the source code you are downloading the 32-Bit one, hence _[master](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master)_ being the default, please note that the only difference between the two branches 32 and 64 is the fact that one is compiled on a 32-Bit arch machine and one on a 64-Bit arch machine. You can visit the repository page _[here on GitHub](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware)_ and then switch your branch to _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master64)_ branch. Then everything is sorted, head-over to the downloads section [here](https://deavmi.github.io/iFirmware/#downloads).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n\r\n* Deavmi - [Website](https://deavmi.github.io/Deavmi) / [Twitter](http://twitter.com/deavmi) / [Send an email](mailto:tristankildaire@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nGraphics\r\n\r\n*  Dakirby309 - [Website](http://dakirby309.deviantart.com) ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
