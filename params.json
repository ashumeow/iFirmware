Supports many Apple devices.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\n\r\nWell after seeing [iH8sn0w](http://ih8sn0w.com/)'s [https://github.com/iH8sn0w/sn0wbreeze](sn0wbreeze) in action, I had seen that it had a built in downloader for iOS firmwares, so I decided to make one of my own, a standalone iOS firmware downloader called iFirmware.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\niFirmware is currently only compatible for 32-Bit arch machines but you could help out with a 64-Bit arch version of iFirmware by re-compiling the source code on your 64-Bit machine and pushing it to the _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master64)_ branch.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Not released yet.\r\n\r\n## Source code\r\n\r\nPlease note that when downloading the source code you are downloading the 32-Bit one, hence _[master](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master)_ being the default, no worries it is the fact that it must be compiled on a 64-Bit machine. You can visit the repository page _[here on GitHub](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware)_ and then switch your branch to _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master64)_ branch. Then everything is sorted, head-over to the downloads section [here](https://deavmi.github.io/iFirmware/#downloads).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
