Supports many Apple devices.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\n\r\nWell after seeing iH8sn0w's sn0wbreeze in action, I had seen that it had a built in down oader for iOS firmwares, so I decided to make one of my own, a standalone iOS firmware downloader called iFirmware.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\niFirmware is currently only compatible for 32-Bit arch machines but you could help out with a 64-Bit arch version of iFirmware by re-compiling the source code on your 64-Bit machine and pushing it to the _[master64](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/tree/master64)_ branch.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Not released yet.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
