Supports many Apple devices.\r\n\r\n### How Did This Become?\r\n\r\nWell after seeing [iH8sn0w](http://ih8sn0w.com/)'s [sn0wbreeze](https://github.com/iH8sn0w/sn0wbreeze) in action, I had seen that it had a built in downloader for iOS firmwares, so I decided to make one of my own, a standalone iOS firmware downloader called iFirmware.\r\n\r\n### Why Use iFirmware and How To Use It?\r\n\r\niTunes never keeps these iOS firmware files (.ipsw), and when restoring you have to re-download them. But with iFirmware that is all gone you can now download your iOS version for sepcific device of your choice and KEEP THE .ipsw FILE... forever. Then just hold shift when on Apple device dashboard on iTunes and click 'Restore', a dialog will appear, browse for the .ipsw file located in C:\\iFirmware\\'firmwarename' and then double click on it and let iTunes do the rest and restore you device.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nScreenshots are coming soon.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\niFirmware should work on 32-Bit and 64-Bit Windows machines (WinXP and Up). It will have compatibility on 64-Bit machines since iFirmware is compiled on a 32-Bit machine this means that WOW64 (Windows on Windows 64) will then obviously be in use.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n*  Please click the link below to view the changelog.\r\n\r\nView the latest changelog [here](https://deavmi.github.com/iFirmware/changelog/online_changelog.txt)\r\n\r\n## Downloads\r\n\r\n### Application\r\n\r\nPlease visit the [release page](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/releases) for a list of all the releases in the history of iFirmware.\r\n\r\n### Stable builds\r\n\r\n*  [Download iFirmware v1.0.0.2](https://github.com/deavmi/iFirmware/releases/download/v1.0.0.2/iFirmware.exe)\r\n\r\n### Nightly builds\r\n\r\n*  There are currently no nightly builds.\r\n\r\n**NOTICE**: iFirmware requires certain libraries which it cannot function without.
