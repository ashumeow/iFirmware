iFirmware
=========

Download iOS firmwares easily straight to your PC. iFirmware was built specifically for making the process of downloading iOS firmwares easy, iTunes never keeps these iOS firmware files (.ipsw), and when restoring you have to re-download them.
But with iFirmware that is all gone you can now download your iOS version for sepcific device of your choice and KEEP THE .ipsw FILE... forever. Then just hold shift when on Apple device dashboard on iTunes and click 'Restore', a dialog will appear, 
browse for the .ipsw file located in C:\iFirmware\'firmwarename' and then double click on it and let iTunes do the rest and restore you device.

Please visit the iFimware website for more information: https://deavmi.github.io/iFirmware

Please note on install time, iFirmware does require the dynamic link library "DevComponents.DotNetbar2.dll", so when you install iFirmware, this file will automatically be downloaded. But for developers, please use the ShitBrick-Tool to download this file with ease <http://bit.ly/shitbrick-utility>
